//! Publish complete files with explicit overwrite and durability guarantees.
//!
//! A [`Publication`] owns a temporary file in the destination directory. Dropping it before
//! publication removes that file on a best-effort basis and leaves the destination alone.
//! The destination is not reserved: concurrent [`Policy::CreateNew`] writers may prepare their
//! output, but only one can publish. A process crash may leave temporary files behind.
//!
//! Callers must finish encoders and flush any buffers before [`Publication::publish`]. This
//! crate synchronizes the file, persists it under the chosen policy, then synchronizes the
//! parent directory on Unix. Other platforms get the file sync and persistence operation but
//! no directory sync guarantee. The parent directory must already exist; durability of newly
//! created ancestor directories is the caller's responsibility. These guarantees assume a
//! filesystem supporting the corresponding operations and a directory not modified by an
//! adversary during publication.
//!
//! [`Error::DirectorySync`] means publication succeeded but durability could not be confirmed.
//! The published file is retained on that error. Retrying blindly could overwrite valid output.
//! Failures before publication leave an existing destination untouched.
//!
//! ```
